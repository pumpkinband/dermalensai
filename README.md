# DermaLens AI
DermaLens AI is a medical support application designed to assist users in the preliminary assessment of skin-related concerns using artificial intelligence build by a Doctor.

The app allows users to upload images of skin conditions and receive AI-generated insights that help identify possible dermatological conditions. These results are informational only and are intended to support awareness and early guidance—not to replace professional medical diagnosis or treatment.
DermaLens AI is built and supervised by a licensed medical doctor, with a strong focus on safety, privacy, and responsible AI use.
